MAKE BLOCKS HAVE SPECIAL POWERS AND ELEMENTS OR SOMETHING:
	ALL SHAPES ALSO HAVE A CHANCE TO SPAWN WITH AN ELEMENT DEPENDING ON THE MAP.
		THIS WILL MAKE THEM HAVE SPECIAL EFFECTS (BURN DMG TO TOWERS, SLOW TOWER
		ATTACK SPEED, ETC.)
	ALL SHAPES HAVE A CHANCE TO SPAWN WITH A "PERSONALITY" WHICH MAKES THEM TANKIER,
		FASTER, MORE JITTERY IN MOVEMENT, HIGHER ACCELERATION, AMONG OTHER THINGS
	
	
	LIKE IF A GRASS ELEMENT TOUCHES A FIRE ELEMENT, THEY BOTH BECOME A SPECIAL NEW ELEMENT
		OR EVEN THE FIRE NOW DOES 2X DMG, WHILE THE GRASS IS TWICE AS FAST OR SOMETHING
	
	MAYBE SOME BLOCKS HAVE LIKE REPULSOR EFFECTS THAT WILL MAKE BLOCKS GET A BURST OF SPEED
		IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
	
	OR SOME HAVE STICKYNESS THAT WILL MAKE BLOCKS STICK TOGETHER, MAKING IT TANKIER
	
	SOME MIGHT DROP OBSTACLES/POWERUPS THAT CAN HELP OTHER BLOCKS
		(enchanter block that doesnt hurt the player, but instead circles around the player
		 whilst dropping powerups for other blocks)
